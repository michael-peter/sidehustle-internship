  <!-- The "header" tag is used to contain the header/navigation elements of a webpage. The navigation of a webpage can also be nested in a "nav" tag which can then be nested in a header tag. This design gives sematic meaning to to our webpage and makes it easy for other programmers to understand our code and also for search engine bots to get a more sensible description of our webpage -->
  <header>

    <!-- Inside this "header" tag, I only put an "h1". In most cases, we would have a logo and a "nav" element in it to house the website navigation markup -->
    <h1>A tribute page to Mosh Hamedani&mdash;100% HTML</h1>

  </header>

  <!-- The main tag is the semantic tag used to section the main content of a webpage from the sidebar of the webpage. We will see another tag used to specify a sidebar later in this code -->
  <main>

    <hr>

    <!-- The "section" tag, as its name implies, allows us to section a larger container, such as the "main" element, into sections of distinct contents. It is more sensible than "div" if what we really intended to do is to group a particular content. The "div" tags could be used to do other things, like create deeply nested sections or create block contents the same way "span" is used to create inline contents -  more on this later. -->
    <section>

      <!-- The "img" tag is inline. If we want the image to display block (be on its own line), we can use a "div" tag to surround it. This is one of the ways divs are sensible to use (or semantically proper). However, I want this image to display inline, so I won't surround it with a div -->

      <!-- I am intentionally using "span" instead of "p" because I was the image to be wrapped. The image can be wrapped by inline elements, like "span" unlike "p" which is a block element by default -->
      <span>This tribute page is
        dedicated to Mosh Hamedani who was my first and best online tutor at the beginning of my 'Computer
        Programming'
        journey in 2019.

        I started with Python which Mosh explained so well that it I was able to write my first Machine Learning
        model
        the
        same day even though I didn't really know what I was doing then. He made programming very simple and
        interesting.
        I liked the way spoke gently, trying well to explain each technical term programmers use.

        His videos are so nice, clear and smooth.

        After learning Python. I also started learning JavaScript, Reactjs, Expressjs, etc from Mosh. I have literally
        consumed 60% of his YouTube videos.
