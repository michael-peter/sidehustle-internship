## Track

This repository is a documentation for the Sidehustle Internship [and bootcamp] program for "Front-end web development". It can be taken as a chronicle of a front-end developer's skills and is suitable for beginners and those who wish to review or compare and contrast their expertise starting from the most basic HTML. The project is progressive and I will continue commiting codes and useful materials until the end of the internship/bootcamp.

A map to access the resources in chronological order (as though you are starting from the beginning) can be found below. The [] and ------ are only an intuitive text-style that represent a directory design where each resource can be access in order. "/" insinuates the root of this repository and the paths signify the routes to resources.


#### Happy coding!!!
