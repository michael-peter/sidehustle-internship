<!-- !DOCTYPE is not essentially an HTML element/tag, it is a first-line description that tells the browser to identify the document as HTML -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<!-- the head tag comprises configuration and description of the webpage -->

<head>
	<!-- the charset is a specification for the type of encoding the webpage uses -->
	<meta charset="utf-8">

	<!-- the viewport meta tag tells the browser to consider the screen size of different devices -->
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width initial-scale=1">

	<!-- the title tag is a label for the webpage -->
	<title>This is an HTML5 example by Michael Peter</title>
</head>

<!-- the body tag is the tag which comprises the obvious elements/content of the webpage -->

<body>

	<!-- the h tags represent headers as in publication, we can use headers ranging from h1 to h6 -->
	<h1>This is h1, the biggest header</h1>
	<h2>h2 is smaller</h2>
	<h3>h3 is even smaller</h3>
	<h4>This is h4</h4>
	<h5>This is h5</h5>
	<h6>... and h6</h6>

	<!-- a p tag is simply a paragraph -->
	<p>This is a paragraph. We can use "lorem ipsum" as placeholders for texts when developing a webpage. Lorem ipsum
		dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Praesentium magnam veritatis nobis
		impedit necessitatibus
		incidunt, maxime unde atque dolore illo eligendi et autem iure molestias? Inventore in molestiae maxime ipsum.</p>

	<!-- one can use <br> for line breaks and <hr> for horizontal rule -->
	<p>There is a line break after this paragraph</p>
	<br>

	<p>There is a horizontal rule after this paragraph</p>
	<hr>

	<!-- text can be formatted with the following tags -->
	<p>There are formatted texts after this paragraph. The formatting tags are styled as inline elements at default. So, I
		am going to add a line break, br tag, after each of them to render the next on a new line.</p>

	<b>This is a bold text</b><br>

	<strong>This is also a bold text</strong><br>

	<u>This text is underlined</u><br>

	<em>This is an emphasized text with the "em" tag, rendered in italics</em><br>

	<i>This is italics as well, with "i" tag</i><br>

	<p>There is an image after this paragraph. We can add images to HTML documents by using the "img" tag. One of its
		attributes is "src" which means source and tells the browser where to get the image from. The source could be a
		remote url on the internet or a local file which we can locate on our computer. We are got the source of this image
		from https://via.placeholder.com/200x200. The other important attribute for the image tag is "alt" which means
		alternative text. It is displayed when the image isn't ready yet or if it could not be found.</p>

	<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x200" alt="alternative text">

	<!-- We can display lists and tables in html as well -->

	<p>This is a paragraph with an ordered list, with the tag "ol" after it. All lists, whether ordered or unordered, have
		list items which are represented by the "li" tag</p>

	<ol>
		<li>First item</li>
		<li>Second item</li>
		<li>Third item with sub-items (as a sub-list)
			<ol>
				<li>First sub item</li>
				<li>Second sub item</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Fourth item</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This is another paragraph with an unordered list after it</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First item</li>
		<li>Second item with sub-items (as a sub-list)
			<ul>
				<li>First sub item</li>
				<li>Second sub item</li>
				<li>Third sub item</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Third item</li>
		<li>Fourth item</li>
		<li>Fifth item</li>
	</ul>



	<p>This is a paragraph with a table after it. HTML tables have two basic sections, the header (first row with
		titles/labels) and other rows. The table is declared/initiated with a "table" tag. Inside the table tag, we have
		table rows, with "tr" tags. Each row has data in it, with the "td" tag. However, the first row, if we want it so,
		could be the labels/column-headers and we use the "th" to signify this. "th" means table header. So we use "th" for
		the first row and "td" for others (if we want a table header). In more critical implementation, though, we would
		have the first row or all rows that mark the table head under the "thead" tag and all other rows under the "tbody"
	</p>


	<table border="5" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Column 1</th>
				<th>Column 2</th>
				<th>Column 3</th>
				<th>Column 4</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>

		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
				<td>Data</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>This is a paragraph after the table. We styled the table a little by adding attributes to the "table" tag, like
		border, cellpadding and cellspacing. There is a horizontal rule, "hr", after this paragraph</p>
	<hr>


	<!-- HTML forms -->
	<p>There is an HTML form after this paragraph. HTML forms are enclosed in the "form" tag which comprises different
		input types - text input, password, email, radio button, checkbox, submit button, reset button. Below are examples
		of these input types.</p>

	<form>
		Name: <br>
		<input type="text" value="My name">
		<br>
		Email: <br>
		<input type="email" value="My Email">
		<br>
		Password: <br>
		<input type="password" value="My Password">
		<br>
		<br>
		<input type="radio" name="gender" type="radio">
		Male
		<br>
		<input type="radio" name="gender" type="radio">
		Female
		<br>
		<input type="checkbox">
		Checkbox 1
		<br>
		<input type="checkbox">
		Checkbox 2
		<br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">
		<br>
		<input type="reset" value="Reset">
	</form>

	<p>We use line breaks ubiquitously because all elememts in a form tag are displayed inline. "br" allows me to render
		them in new lines</p>


	<p>The form inputs can have default values and these are represented by the attribute "value". The "submit" input type
		is a button which submits the form [programmatically] while the "reset" input type resets the inputs to the initial
		values we put or empties them if we didn't put initial values. The "value" attribute is also used for the submit and
		reset buttons so as to label them (since they are buttons and not text fields). There are other attributes and one
		of them is "placeholder" which only labels a field but is not an actual text that one can delete (it is replaced as
		soon as the user types into the field). It is used to
		hint the user what information is expected in that field.</p>
